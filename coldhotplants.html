        <h1>Cold Room Plants</h1>
        <p>
          Here is a list of great cold hardy houseplants for your home. One
          thing to keep in mind is that the cooler your room, the longer you can
          go in between watering. Keeping plants too wet (and cold) will invite
          root rot, so be careful of this balance.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia):</b> ZZ plant is a very tough
            houseplant that not only survives low light and very dry conditions,
            but is also a great choice for cooler rooms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cast Iron Plant (Aspidistra elatior):</b> Like the name implies,
            cast iron plant is another very tough houseplant that will survive
            less than ideal conditions, including cold rooms. As long as it
            stays above freezing (32 F. or 0 C.), it will survive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Geraniums (Pelargonium):</b> Geraniums can be a delightful indoor
            plant for colder rooms, as long as you make sure that they receive a
            few hours of direct sunshine every day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Snake Plant (Sansevieria):</b> The ubiquitous snake plant is a
            tremendous houseplant that will survive almost anywhere. It will
            take low light, cool temperatures, and dry soil very well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Dracaena (Dracaena marginata):</b> Dracaenacan also handle cooler
            temperatures with ease. It can withstand temperatures of 50 degrees
            F. (10 C.) and above with no concern.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All of these winter houseplants mentioned have their limits, so be
          careful not to push those limits too much. Keep an eye on your plants
          to make sure they are responding favorably to the cooler conditions.

        <h1>Hot Room Plants</h1>

        <p>
          When temperatures are soaring, you try your best to keep the house
          cool and stay out of the heat. However, some plants need the higher
          temperatures to thrive. Here is a list of plants to keep in your
          hotter rooms:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Succulents:</b> It’s no surprise these colourful plants are on
            trend right now, given their beauty and effortless maintenance.
            Although green succulents are more suited to indoors than their
            brighter variants, place your plant near a window that gets light
            all day so it’s bound to thrive! Since its thick and sturdy leaves
            store moisture, you only need to water it once a week, and will even
            be forgiven after two weeks of neglect!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cacti:</b> We’re all guilty of occasionally neglecting our indoor
            plants, especially in hot temperatures when we’re more concerned
            with hydrating ourselves. Luckily for us, cacti appreciate a light
            and warm spot, coping well in direct sunlight and being watered once
            a month is perfectly fine. And with plenty of choice in shapes and
            sizes, it’s an easy way to inject green into your home without the
            stress!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Aloe Vera:</b> Renowned for a medicinal ability to heal wounds,
            it turns out aloe vera plants are quite tough themselves. Often
            referred to as the ‘plant of immortality’ it’s easy to see how that
            name was acquired, as they can survive in all manner of environments
            and require minimal attention. Simply leave your plant in direct
            sunlight, water it every now and then and you’ll have one healthy
            aloe vera!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Devil's Ivy:</b> Devil’s Ivy are a popular choice for indoor
            plants, both resilient and pretty. Think low maintenance and no
            nonsense, able to adapt and thrive in bright indirect light and low
            light. The plant only needs to be watered infrequently, so even when
            temperatures are soaring there’s no need to worry about it wilting.
            Their bigger leaves also transpire, releasing excess water into the
            air cooling themselves and the surrounding environment that helps
            with the humidity in your home.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Ponytail Palm (Dracaena):</b> Ponytail palm trees certainly help
            to create that tropical, beachy feel in the comfort of your own
            home. Easy to keep happy and requiring little of your attention to
            grow and thrive, they are the perfect indoor plant. The
            Mexican-native is happiest when basking in a bright, sunny spot
            although can easily adapt to low light conditions. The key is to
            allow the soil to dry out completely between watering.
