      <h1>Cold Room Plants</h1>
      <p>
        Here is a list of great cold hardy houseplants for your home. One thing
        to keep in mind is that the cooler your room, the longer you can go in
        between watering. Keeping plants too wet (and cold) will invite root
        rot, so be careful of this balance.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia):</b> ZZ plant is a very tough
          houseplant that not only survives low light and very dry conditions,
          but is also a great choice for cooler rooms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cast Iron Plant (Aspidistra elatior):</b> Like the name implies,
          cast iron plant is another very tough houseplant that will survive
          less than ideal conditions, including cold rooms. As long as it stays
          above freezing (32 F. or 0 C.), it will survive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Geraniums (Pelargonium):</b> Geraniums can be a delightful indoor
          plant for colder rooms, as long as you make sure that they receive a
          few hours of direct sunshine every day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Snake Plant (Sansevieria):</b> The ubiquitous snake plant is a
          tremendous houseplant that will survive almost anywhere. It will take
          low light, cool temperatures, and dry soil very well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Dracaena (Dracaena marginata):</b> Dracaenacan also handle cooler
          temperatures with ease. It can withstand temperatures of 50 degrees F.
          (10 C.) and above with no concern.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of these winter houseplants mentioned have their limits, so be
        careful not to push those limits too much. Keep an eye on your plants to
        make sure they are responding favorably to the cooler conditions.
