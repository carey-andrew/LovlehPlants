                    Types of Plants: Plants are all unique regarding physical
                    appearance, structure, and physiological behavior. Aside
                    from that, they also vary in their habitats, tolerance, and
                    nutrient requirement. So with that kind of diversity, the
                    big question is, how do you exactly start to classify them?
                    Good thing botanists have already devised ways to classify
                    them. In fact, classifying plants is considered as one of
                    the oldest approaches in studying botany.

                    In general, botanists group plants into two major groups:
                    non-vascular and vascular. The former being composed of
                    early plants while the latter consists of plants which had
                    developed a vascular system.However, this kind of grouping
                    seems to be very general and covers a wide variety of scope.
                    The more commonly used plant classification is the more
                    specific one: by classifying them into different phyla.
