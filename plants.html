          Types of Plants: Plants are all unique regarding physical appearance,
          structure, and physiological behavior. Aside from that, they also vary
          in their habitats, tolerance, and nutrient requirement. So with that
          kind of diversity, the big question is, how do you exactly start to
          classify them? Good thing botanists have already devised ways to
          classify them. In fact, classifying plants is considered as one of the
          oldest approaches in studying botany.

          In general, botanists group plants into two major groups: non-vascular
          and vascular. The former being composed of early plants while the
          latter consists of plants which had developed a vascular
          system.However, this kind of grouping seems to be very general and
          covers a wide variety of scope. The more commonly used plant
          classification is the more specific one: by classifying them into
          different phyla.

          Most plants have roots, a stem, and leaves. Every part of a plant has
          its own job. All these parts work together to help a plant grow. The
          strong stem carries water, and leaves make food. Roots hold a plant in
          place and take in water and minerals. Plants have either taproots or
          fibrous roots. A plant with a taproot has one main root that goes
          straight down. Plants with fibrous roots have lots of thin roots that
          spread out. If you add them up, a plant's fibrous roots can be very
          long. A winter rye grass plant can have up to 385 miles (620 km) of
          fibrous roots!

          The green color of leaves comes from green matter called chlorophyll.
          Plants need chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the way
          plants make their own food. During photosynthesis, a plant takes in
          sunlight, a gas from the air called carbon dioxide , and water. Using
          these three things and chlorophyll, the plant produces a food called
          glucose. Plants also give off oxygen during photosynthesis. The
          needles on evergreen trees are really long, thin leaves. Needles have
          chlorophyll and are able to carry out photosynthesis, just like other
          leaves.
